## Finite Automata converting algorithms
## info

```enfa_nfa```          - converts Îµ-NFA to NFA <br>
```nfa_dfa```           - converts NFA to DFA <br>
```dfa_minimization```  - minimizes DFA <br>

graphviz is used to draw the models and export them on JPG, PNG, PDF... <br>

```sudo apt-get install graphviz``` <br>
```pip3 install graphviz```

If you don't want drawn model comment out in code
